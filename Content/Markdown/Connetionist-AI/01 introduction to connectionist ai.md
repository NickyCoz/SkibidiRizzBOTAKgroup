# Chapter 1: Introduction to Connectionist AI (Brief)

## 1. What Is Connectionist AI?

**Connectionism** is an approach to building intelligent systems from **many simple processing units that are linked together**. No single unit is intelligent. The behaviour of the whole system comes from **how the units are connected** and **how strong each connection is**.

The idea is inspired by the brain, where billions of neurons communicate through connections called **synapses**. Learning in the brain is believed to involve strengthening or weakening these synapses. Connectionist AI copies this idea in a simplified, mathematical form:

| Biology | Artificial version |
|---|---|
| Neuron | Unit / node that computes a number |
| Synapse (connection) | **Weight**, a learnable number |
| Strengthening a synapse | Increasing a weight |
| Learning from experience | Adjusting weights to reduce error |

> **Important:** artificial neural networks are only *loosely* inspired by the brain. They are mathematical models, not accurate simulations of biology.

The most successful modern form of connectionist AI is the **artificial neural network (ANN)**, and especially **deep learning**, which uses networks with many layers.

## 2. The Core Principles of Connectionism

1. **Many simple units.** Each unit does a tiny calculation (weighted sum plus a non-linear function).
2. **Parallel processing.** Many units compute at the same time, which suits modern GPUs.
3. **Distributed representation.** A concept like "cat" is not stored in one place. It is spread across many units and weights, and one unit takes part in many concepts.
4. **Learning by adjusting weights.** Knowledge is not programmed in. It is acquired from examples.
5. **Graceful degradation.** Damaging a few units usually reduces performance slightly rather than breaking everything (unlike deleting one rule from a rule list).
6. **Generalisation.** A trained network can handle new inputs it has never seen, as long as they resemble its training data.

## 3. Symbolic AI vs Connectionist AI

Early AI (1950s to 1980s) was mostly **symbolic**: experts wrote explicit rules and logic. Connectionism took a different route: learn from data.

| | Symbolic AI | Connectionist AI |
|---|---|---|
| Knowledge stored as | Explicit rules, facts, logic | Numbers (weights) in a network |
| Built by | Human experts encoding knowledge | Learning from examples |
| Handles noisy or messy input | Poorly | Well |
| Explanation of decisions | Clear | Hard |
| Needs lots of data | No | Usually yes |
| Good at | Logic, planning, exact reasoning | Perception, language, pattern recognition |
| Example | "IF temperature > 38 THEN fever" | A network trained on thousands of X-rays |

Neither approach is simply better. Modern research increasingly explores **neuro-symbolic AI**, which combines learning with explicit reasoning.

## 4. A Short History

| Year | Milestone | Why it mattered |
|---|---|---|
| 1943 | McCulloch and Pitts publish a mathematical model of a neuron | First formal "artificial neuron" |
| 1949 | Donald Hebb proposes that connections strengthen with use | Early learning principle ("cells that fire together wire together") |
| 1958 | Frank Rosenblatt builds the **Perceptron** | First trainable neural model |
| 1969 | Minsky and Papert show a single perceptron cannot learn XOR | Funding and interest collapse: the first **AI winter** |
| 1986 | Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams popularise **backpropagation** | Multi-layer networks become trainable |
| 1989 to 1998 | LeCun's convolutional networks read handwritten digits | Practical success, mostly in niche uses |
| 1997 | LSTM networks introduced | Better memory for sequences |
| 2012 | AlexNet wins the ImageNet competition by a large margin | Starts the **deep learning** boom |
| 2014 to 2016 | GANs; deep reinforcement learning beats humans at Go | Generation and decision-making breakthroughs |
| 2017 | The **Transformer** architecture is introduced | Foundation of modern language models |
| 2020s | Large-scale models for text, images, audio, code | Connectionist AI becomes mainstream |

## 5. Why Did It Take So Long to Work?

Three ingredients had to arrive together:

1. **Data.** The internet created huge datasets (photos, text, clicks, sensor data).
2. **Compute.** GPUs, originally made for video games, turned out to be ideal for the matrix maths neural networks need.
3. **Better algorithms.** Improved activation functions, optimizers, initialisation, normalisation and architectures made deep networks trainable.

## 6. Your First Neuron: A Hands-On Example

A single neuron computes a **weighted sum of inputs plus a bias**, then applies a decision rule. Let's build a neuron that behaves like the logical **AND** gate (output 1 only if both inputs are 1).

Choose weights `w = [1, 1]` and bias `b = -1.5`. Rule: output 1 if the sum is greater than 0, else 0.

| input1 | input2 | Sum = 1·x1 + 1·x2 − 1.5 | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | −1.5 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | −0.5 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | −0.5 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0.5 | 1 |

It works. Here we chose the weights by hand. A *learning* algorithm would find them automatically from examples, which is the whole point of connectionism.

```python
def neuron(input1, input2, w=(1, 1), bias=-1.5):
    value = w[0]*input1 + w[1]*input1 + bias
    return 1 if value > 0 else 0

for input1 in (0, 1):
    for input2 in (0, 1):
        print(input1, input2, "->", neuron(input1, input2))
```

**The XOR problem.** XOR (output 1 if the inputs *differ*) cannot be solved by any single neuron, because no straight line separates its 1s from its 0s. Adding a **hidden layer** solves it. This is exactly why multi-layer networks matter (Chapter 2).

## 7. Common Misconceptions

- **"Neural networks work like the brain."** They are loosely inspired by it and far simpler.
- **"More layers is always better."** Deeper networks need more data and care, and can overfit.
- **"It's a black box nobody understands."** Much is understood about training and behaviour, but explaining individual decisions is hard, and active research (interpretability) addresses it.
- **"AI means neural networks."** AI also includes symbolic methods, search, probabilistic models and more.

## Key Takeaways
- Connectionism builds intelligence from many simple connected units whose weights are learned.
- It excels at messy, perceptual data; symbolic AI excels at explicit logic.
- Data, compute and better algorithms made deep learning take off around 2012.
- A single neuron is limited; layers give networks their power.
