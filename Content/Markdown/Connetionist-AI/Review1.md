# Connectionist AI Peer Review


I found the explanations generally understandable and the key worked calculations correct. I checked the forward pass, gradient update, forecasting errors, Gaussian loss, recommendation score, and Q-learning update. All 21 Python blocks passed syntax checks. All 155 local links resolved, and all 143 referenced SVGs passed structural checks.

I recommend these revisions before approval:

- I found no references or citations in any lesson. I recommend adding sources for the historical, mathematical, and application claims. I cross-checked selected claims against PyTorch documentation, Forecasting: Principles and Practice, and the original PPO paper.
- In Chapter 06, line 196, I would correct the claim that an interval from zero to infinity is perfectly calibrated. For nonnegative outcomes it gives 100% coverage; that does not make it a calibrated 80% or 90% interval.
- In Chapter 09, line 237, I would clarify that PPO clips its objective to discourage large policy changes. It does not guarantee a strict limit on policy change.
- In Chapter 10, lines 282–319, I would supply the missing training and validation loaders, example data, and expected shapes. I would also weight validation losses by sample count because equally averaging batch means overweights a smaller final batch.
- In Chapter 05, line 266, I would distinguish the target stock level from the order quantity. Ordering also needs to account for existing inventory, outstanding orders, and backorders.
- I would add library installation and execution instructions, clarify the input-sign assumption behind Chapter 02's weight explanation, and describe Chapter 04's zero ReLU derivative as a chosen convention at its nondifferentiable point.

I used a separate AI learner walkthrough for Chapters 02, 06, and 09. It reached the supplied practice answers but identified missing setup in Chapter 10 as an execution blocker. I made no corrections.
