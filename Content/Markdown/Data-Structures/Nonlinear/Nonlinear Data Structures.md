# Nonlinear Data Structures

## What are nonlinear data structures?

A nonlinear data structure does not arrange its elements in one sequence. Its elements connect in a hierarchy or a network. Some common examples are trees and graphs. They are useful when data has relationships that are difficult to represent as a simple linear sequence.

## Characteristics

- Elements are connected through relationships rather than placed in one sequence.
- The structure can have multiple levels or branches.
- Traversal follows the structure's connections to visit elements.
- Trees represent hierarchical relationships, graphs represent networked relationships.
- How elements are connected affects how searching and traversal work.

## Examples of Nonlinear Data Structures

- [Graphs](Graphs.md)

## Linear and nonlinear structures

| Linear structure | Nonlinear structure |
| --- | --- |
| Elements are arranged sequentially. | Elements connect hierarchically or as a network. |
| Positions in the sequence determine the order. | Trees can branch into levels. Graphs can connect vertices in a network. |
| Examples: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues. | Examples: trees and graphs. |
| Traversal follows the sequence. | Traversal follows connections and depends on the structure. |

## Try it

![Friendship graph with Nicky, Darren, Neil, and Glen.](../../../../Assets/Data%20Structures/Static/friendship-graph.svg)

Which people can be reached directly from Nicky? Which person can be reached by following two edges from Nicky?

**Expected answer.** Darren and Neil can be reached directly. Glen can be reached in two steps through either Darren or Neil.
